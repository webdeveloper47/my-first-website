    <p>There are many classical instances of love that remain immortal in history.  A unique instance set by Mahmudul and Fahmida in Chattogram on March 9 </span> may find its place in the history of love in the future. 
    Mahmudul Hasan, 30, hailing from Chakaria upazila of Cox's Bazar, completed BBA and MBA from North South University in Dhaka while his paramour, Fahmida Kamal, 25, a resident of South Bakalia in the port city, completed BBA and MBA from Independent University Bangladesh.My shoe,” she confirms, “Is there a foot inside?”
        
    “Looks empty,” I tell her. I notice my hands are balled into fists. I open them. “Do we just…stay here?”
    
    My wife says, “I’m pretty sure that…” and another pause that’s either a second or a century “…we can do whatever we want.” 
    
    “Well then.” I sound motivated, but I don’t move. “I’m gonna have a look at the wreck. Coming?”
    
    “No,” she tells me. “I don’t want to.”
    
    Something like a laugh springs from my mouth. It sounds like a frother steaming mud. I feel funny and I laugh again because I’m so relieved to feel anything. It feels normal and good. Feeling feels good. 
    
    
    “You wanted to.”
    
    “True,” she says, “But I’m just not interested in empty shells.”
    
    And then she looks at me for the first time with the same eyebrow raised. “You want to see our dead bodies? Bullshit.”
    
    Now I’m shrugging. “I can take the gore.” 
    
    “The sight of your own veins makes you queasy.”
    
    “I like scary movies.”
    
    “You like cartoon anatomy,” she clarifies. “But if it gets real...” 
    
    She squeezes her eyes shut, covers her ears, and goes “la-la-la” to make her point. It’s a good point. Clinical butchery makes me black out. But not anymore. Not after the rock. 
    
    The rock changed me in more ways than one.
    
    “I’m still me,” I say, smiling. “I think you’re still you.”
    
    “I guess we are. But who were we? What did we do?”
    
    I move. I think I’m walking. But there’s no tensing in my muscles, no popping in my knees. It’s weird and slow, but good. I’m still smiling. I say, “Baby, anything we forget is probably not worth remembering!” 
    
    While I walk, she’s saying, “I remember what it feels like to hear a knock at the front door, knowing there’s a hot pizza waiting on the other side. I remember trees turning red and yellow and orange. Not like this.” She sounds disgusted. “All green…” 
    
    “I remember that,” I say.
    
    She goes on, “I remember the first sip of great wine out of the bottle and how it changes when it’s the last sip. I remember purring cats and photographs and staying home and seeing no one. I remember our wedding vows.”
    
   
    “Not so loud,” my wife tells me. “I can hear you just fine.”</p>
